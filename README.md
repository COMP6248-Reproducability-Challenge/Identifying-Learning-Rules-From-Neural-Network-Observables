The paper uses TensorFlow version 1.13.1 to conduct all model training experiments. The model function code and the names of the model layers from where they generated statistics are provided in Github. A brief tutorial is given in the Google Colab notebook on the use of many parts of this codebase, including analyzing the dataset, visualizing saved classifier results, and training classifiers on the dataset. Majority of the reproducibility experiments was implemented basing on the tutorial in the notebook, with some parts of the original code for reproducibility.
